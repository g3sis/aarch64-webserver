# A tiny aarch64 "webserver"

Pretty basic implementation of opening and binding a socket, then accepting a connection and sending index.html.
Built using man pages, syscall tables and a few hours of my time. Not optimized at all.

## Usage:
```
make
sudo server.s
```

## Yet to come:

- images
- actual request handling
- enjoying life again
