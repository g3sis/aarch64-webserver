# A tiny aarch64 "webserver"

Pretty basic implementation of opening and binding a socket, then accepting a connection and sending selected files.
Built using man pages, syscall tables and a few hours of my time. Not optimized at all.

## Usage:
```
python images.py
make
sudo ./server
```

## Yet to come:
- local https in some way
